Movie Status Report: Computing Vision

I.- Introduction
A) Overview/Business Understanding

We have been tasked with determining which type of movie would be the best investment for a new movie studio. Based on empirical data collected over the past couple of years. We want your initial investment in a movie to be successful so you can hit the ground running in your new and exciting venture. For that to be a success, we have taken a deep dive into the data to determine how long a movie should be, what rating, and how much to spend to insure a hit in the box office.



B) Objectives
    1. Analyze empirical data based on the last few years
    2. Visualize the analyzed data
    3. Explain the vizualizations
    4. Determine the best course of action for the initial investment

lll.- Determining Data

A) Data Source
    1. Box Office Mojo - Domestic gross, foreign gross, release year
    2. Rotten Tomatoes - MPAA rating, runtime, box office
    3. The Movie Database - Popularity rating, average popularity vote
    4. The Numbers - Production budget, domestic gross, worldwide gross
    
B) Data Understanding
    1. Runtime - How long a movie lasts
    2. Age Rating - The age bracket and potential age restrictions determined by the MPAA
    3. Movie Budget - The amount invested in film production

lll.- Statistical Communication
A) From the data we found out that PG-13 and PG made the most revenue on average. We believe that family friednly movies make more money because they have a wider audience.
B) From the data we found out that the more money a studio spends on production, the money they'll generate from the worldwide box-office on average.
C) From the data we found that movies that are shorter the average run-time of 107 minutes on average don't usually make as much money as longer movies.
    

V.- In conclusion, our recommendations align with studios who do have the enough capital to make a high production family friendly movie that will a run-time greater than 107 minutes. We believe this strategy will have the highest return on investment because the data shows that movie studio who make the same decision, on average see consistent return.
