    "    We have been tasked with determining which type of movie would be the best investment for a new movie studio. Based on empirical data collected over the past couple of years. We want your initial investment in a movie to be successful so you can hit the ground running in your new and exciting venture. For that to be a success, we have taken a deep dive into the data to determine how long a movie should be, what rating, and how much to spend to insure a hit in the box office.\n",
